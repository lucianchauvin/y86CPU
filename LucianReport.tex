\section{My Contributions}
Throughout this project I created the decode module along with putting together the memory module. I also completed a lot of debugging and did a good bit of writing the final lab report.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item My name is Lucian Chauvin and my group members were Joshua Lass and Bjorn Quarfordt.
    \item Both my group members worked very hard and well. I was pleased with them and what they did. I think our only problem was that we procrastinated too much.
\end{enumerate}
